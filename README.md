# Project Title

Motion detection with email alerts using esp8266

## Getting Started

This project allow to to use esp8266 with a PIR sensor to monitor and detect motion. In the case of no motion detected within a specific timeframe an email is sent to remind the user to turn off the Air condtioner.


### Prerequisites

The tools and equipment used 

* esp8266
* PIR sensor
* breadboard

2- The GND of the PIR sensor needs to be connected to the GND of the esp8266
3- The output of the PIR sensor needs to be connected to the D1 pin

## Code setup

When using the code there are lines that needs to be adjusted depending on the WIFI connection used and the email address ;

const char* ssid = "YourWiFiSSID";
const char* password = "YourWiFiPassword";
